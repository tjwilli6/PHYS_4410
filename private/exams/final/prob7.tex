\question \textbf{This is an optional problem. If you attempt it, it can replace your worst scoring problem, if it is to your benefit}\\Consider a \textit{relativistic} gas of electrons inside a cube of side $L$ at $T=0$. The momenta of the electrons are quantized:
\begin{align*}
	p_x&=\frac{\hbar\pi}{L}n_x\\
	p_y&=\frac{\hbar\pi}{L}n_y\\
	p_z&=\frac{\hbar\pi}{L}n_z\\
\end{align*}
Since the electrons energies are well above their rest mass, the energy is given by $pc$ rather than $\frac{p^2}{2m}$.

\begin{parts}
	\part What is the energy of the highest occupied energy state in the gas (the fermi energy $\varepsilon_F$)?
	\vspace{5cm}
	\part What is the total internal energy of the gas? (You may write your answer in terms of $\varepsilon_F$ if you wish)
