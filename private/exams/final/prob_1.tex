\question You are given two electrons and two protons. What is one possible way to arrange the four charges such that the net electric field at the origin will be zero? (To specify your arrangement, give the $x$, $y$,  and $z$ coordinates of each charge, and sketch the arrangement.)

\textit{Note: there may be many possible answers, but you \textbf{may not} arrange all of the charges on the same axis!}
