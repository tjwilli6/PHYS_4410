\question An Einstein solid in equilibrium at temperature $T$ consists of $N$ oscillators with $q$ many energy ``units'' of $\hbar\omega$ distributed among them (so that the total energy is $U=q\hbar\omega$). In the ``low energy limit'' ($q<<N$), the multiplicity of this system is given by\footnote{Actually, this limit is not valid classically, since at low temperature we need to take into account quantum mechanics, but you may blissfully ignore all of that here}:
\begin{equation*}
	\Omega\approx\left(\frac{eN}{q}\right)^q
\end{equation*}

\begin{parts}
	\part What is the internal energy of this system (in terms of temperature, don't just write $q\hbar\omega$)
	\vspace{5cm}
	\part What is the constant-volume heat capacity $C_V$?
