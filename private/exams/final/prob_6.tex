\question Two uniformly charged spherical shells are concentric with a point charge at the shared center (see figure). The point charge has a charge $Q_{pt} = -4\ \mu$C. The inner shell has a total charge $Q_{inner}=2\ \mu$C, and radius $R_1=0.2$ m, and the outer shell has a total charge $Q_{outer}=-2\ \mu$C and a radius $R_2=0.3$ m. The shells are separated by vacuum (they are not in conductive contact).

\part What is the potential difference between the surfaces of the inner and outer shell?
\part What is the magnitude of the net force experienced by a proton placed 0.5 m away from the center of the shells?
