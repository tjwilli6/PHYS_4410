\question[30] A tiny paramagnet consists of 10 electrons with two possible spin states (either parallel or anti-parallel to the magnetic field). The system is at room temperature (300 K). Initially, the magnetic field is very weak, so that 5 of the 10 electrons are aligned with the field and 5 are anti aligned. For what value of the magnetic field will the system spontaneously transition to a state where 80\% of the electron magnetic moments are aligned with the field? The magnetic moment of an electron is given by: $\mu_B=\frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}$.
