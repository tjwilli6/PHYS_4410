\question An insulating sphere of radius $R$ = \radius{} lies with its center at the origin. The sphere has positive charge of $Q$ = \Q{} spread uniformly over its surface. A point charge with charge \qpt{} lies on the $x-$axis at \qloc. You may neglect the polarization of the insulator (assume the polarizability$\alpha$ is 0)
