\question 15 L of mono-atomic ideal gas at atmospheric pressure and a temperature of 300 K is adiabatically compressed to 1/5 of its initial volume (1 L = $10^{-3}$ m$^3$).
\begin{parts}
	\part[5] How much heat enters the gas during this process?
	\part[10] How much work is done on the gas during this process?
	\part[10] What is the final temperature of the gas?
	\part[10] What is the change in entropy of the gas for this process?
\end{parts}
