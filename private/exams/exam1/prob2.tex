\question Two Einstein solids $A$ and $B$ are in contact such that they can freely share energy. Each solid has $N=10^{23}$ oscillators, and they share a number of energy units $q$ which is much greater than the number of oscillators (the solids are both at high temperature).
\begin{parts}
	\part[10] Show that the most likely macrostate corresponds to the equal sharing of energy: $q_A=q_B=\frac{q}{2}$
	\part [15]What is the approximate probability of a 0.1\% deviation from the most likely macrostate? (i.e. $q_A = 0.501 q$, $q_B = 0.499 q$). There is no need to find the \textit{exact} probability, just find it relative to the most likely macrostate, which is overwhelmingly more likely.
