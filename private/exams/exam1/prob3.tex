\question[20] A 250 g object of unknown material is initially in thermal equilibrium with a large pot of boiling water. The object is then rapidly removed and placed inside of 600 g of cool water (T=20$^\circ$ C). The temperature of the water rises, eventually stopping when it reaches 26$^\circ$ C. What is the specific heat capacity of the unknown object? The specific heat of water is 4.186 J/(g$^\circ$ C). Assume the 600 g of water is thermally isolated from everything except the object (no energy leaves the water and enters the surroundings).
