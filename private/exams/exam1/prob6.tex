\question Two driverless cars are about to collide at an intersection. One car (with a mass of 1100 kg) is moving from west to east (call this the $+x$ direction) with a speed of 20 m/s. The other car (with a mass of 1500 kg) is moving from south to north (the $+y$ direction) with a speed of 18 m/s. After the cars crash, they remain stuck together.
\begin{parts}
	\part[10] What is the velocity of the two stuck-together cars just after the collision (ignore friction)? Express your result as a vector.

	\part[5] What angle do the two stuck-together cars move with relative to the $x$ axis after the collision? Express your result in degrees.
